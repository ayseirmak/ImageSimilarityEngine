## Image Similarity Engine via AutoEncoder
An image similarity search engine has been developed which identifies images similar to the image selected by the user from a dataset. The latent vectors of the images are generated by a CNN based autoencoder model. The nearest neighbour algorithm was used to find images similar to the selected image. The similarity measure used by the algorithm (Euclidean/Cosine) and the methods used to obtain the latent vector (MaxPoll/Flatten) were obtained from the user. An image similarity search engine platform was created to visualise to demonstraite research.
